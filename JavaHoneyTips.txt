Java honey tips

1. garbage collector 
- automatically memory management
- don't have to 'delete' objects
- delete objects (when no references pointing to them)

2. I/O : Scanner/System.out

3. Date & Time
- import java.util.Date;
- import java.text.SimpleDateFormat;
ex 1)
final Date now = new Date( );
final SimpleDateFormat format = new SimpleDateFormat ("E yyyy.MM.dd 'at' hh:mm:ss a zzz");

System.out.println("Current Date: " + format.format(now));
// Current Date: ¼ö 2020.09.09 at 03:07:17 ¿ÀÈÄ KST

- delay
Thread.sleep(3 * 1000); // throws InterruptedException

4. Enhanced for loop 
- for ( final int i : numbers ) { ... }

5. 'final' keyword for constants
- final int a = 10;

6. HashMap
- import java.util.HashMap;
- import java.util.Map;

7. 'static' keyword 
-When a member is declared as static, it means it is associated with the class itself, not with individual objects created from the class.

Static Variables (Class Variables):
- Static variables are also known as class variables because they are shared among all instances (objects) of the class.

Static Methods:
- They are declared using the static keyword and can be called using the class name, without creating an object.

Static Blocks:
- Static blocks are used to initialize static variables or perform one-time setup for the class.

Ex)
public class MyClass {
    static {
        // Initialization code for static variables
        staticVar = 20;
    }
    static int staticVar;
}

Static Nested Classes:
- Static nested classes can be instantiated without an instance of the outer class.

Ex) main method of Java Class..
public class ArrayEnum {
    public static void main(String[] args) { ... }
